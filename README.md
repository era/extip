Extip (or little Kelso)
------------

This Phoenix app was created to test the [pay lib](https://github.com/era/pay/). It's a very stupid app that don't validate anything, but it's still a good example of how the pay lib works.

If you want, you can use it as a start model to create your own "pay me a coffee" page, but don't use it as it is in production.
